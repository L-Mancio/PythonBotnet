# PythonBotnet
A python Botnet Implementation
 
The objective is to create a class that manages a botnet, and the individual bots.
The user can give commands to either manage the botnet, or perform certain operations from any bot contained in the botnet

Cool features:
  -Each Botnet entry can hold several different bots, so if you're able to obtain access in n-different ways you can store all the n-bots for quick access
  in the same botnet entry
  -simple custom bot commands directly from command prompt
